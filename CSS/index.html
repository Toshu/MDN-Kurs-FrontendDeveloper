    <h1>Jane Doe</h1>
    <div class="job-title">Web Developer</div>
    <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind
        texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>

    <p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
        paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were
    <ul class="danger">
        <li>thousands of bad Commas,</li>
        <li>wild Question Marks and</li>
        <li>devious Semikoli,</li>
    </ul> but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into
    the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last
    view back <span>on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove</span>, <span> the headline of Alphabet Village</span>
    and <span>the subline of her own road, the Line Lane</span>.
